its still 2018
--------------


november 15
    moved country or something. woops!
    tried out a bunch of makefile stuff
    also tried out xcode. dont use same name/same dir or else you'll delete everything you've done
    the current focus is on a build system
    to make something like this cross platform cmake might be the easiest choice.
