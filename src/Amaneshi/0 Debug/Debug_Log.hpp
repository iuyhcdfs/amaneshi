// something to hook onto tasks and just log activity.
// check when a task is opened and closed
// youll be able to know enough culprits then

// oh and, just make each thread log independently.
// is that okay? if each thread writes to different files they shouldnt crash

// if you give everything a debugname, detect type and just print what everything was doing
// is that good or bad hmm
// 
// gotta make some serial stuff too then
