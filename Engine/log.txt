    cmake stuff fixed
    public folders hopefully work well

January 9/10 wednesday thursday
    study more aggressively and try small projects to make things manageable
    you instead learnt cmake in the space of 20 minutes

    lets make this project work out. and swap between this and poppi as you feel

    old log isnt relevant anymore

=======================
2019 has come

december 26 wednesday
    
    excuse me i need to be able to read my textbook completely
    and read faster than a middle-schooler.

    is it a module>? give it a cmakelists
    if you can't just copypaste a folder to another area
    youre using the build system wrong


november 22 thursday
    nailed the japanese test
    cmake lists just need to be made per... type of folder
    make some fake cross folder dependencies to see if the code is tight

    cmake. lets get rid of stupid hacky visual studio redirecting headers
    if something SHOULD have public/private then let's do it
    if a folder is definetly going to have all its headers be public then dont do it
        but how do you know you won't make an extra utility header that people shouldn't use?
        ok try to almost always make public private then    
        >> its okay because cmakelists can list subdirectories instead of making a cmakelists file in each subdir
    make glfw link preferably via the lib folder instead of having it installed with clang
        prefer portability

    still settling after having moved country or something. woops!
    tried out a bunch of makefile stuff
    also tried out xcode. dont use same name/same dir or else you'll delete everything you've done
    the current focus is on a build system
    to make something like this cross platform cmake might be the easiest choice.
