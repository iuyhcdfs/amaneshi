visual studio 2017

got glew, got glfw, 
put in folder called external
right click project name in project explorer
properties
go into c/c++ section, general and add additional include directories
go into linker, general, add additional library dirs
linker, input, additional dependencies
opengl32.lib
glew32.lib
glfw3.lib

trying the static version of glew for some reason results in errors
unresolved external symbols. and LNK4098
OH this might be because we dumped the glew32.dll everywhere
because this error could occur due to using both static and dynamic

Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Warning	LNK4098	defaultlib 'MSVCRT' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library	amaneshi  etc etc etc hi there\amaneshi\LINK	1	

actually also because using with glfw which is dynamic. ok. 

not certain yet. should research more.

did it for 32 bit
you redo it for 64 bit i guess. 

 the ide is basically doing the same as your previous makefiles
 you just have to navigate different menus. look up guides, whatever it takes.
