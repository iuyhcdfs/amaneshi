amaneshi is my game engine. it was built so that i could learn about game engines while building it.

freely use the code for anything besides claiming you spent the time and effort on it :P

goals:
 - use c++ only without worrying about targeting varying systems or consoles HOO
 - code is reusuable and consistent enough
 - enjoy creating the code you'd just use existing libraries for when you're making a proper game
