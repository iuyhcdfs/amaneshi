this repository held a pretty bad ideal of making a sandbox to try things in

its more important to build things with purpose

a game engine for example shouldn't really be called an engine
its just a game after all. but some elements are in common.

all game engines are just games that happen to be a subset of many other games, thus providing a nice starting point

but if you wanted to make a sandbox of code, you can't make a subset of literally everything without building hardly anything at all. you're stuck thinking about too many things.
