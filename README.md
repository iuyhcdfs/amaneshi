a c++ sandbox for learning:

 - what makes a good build system?
 - how to structure modules and dependencies?
 - how to use opengl?
 - playing with multithreading
 - how to make a codebase connect to other libraries easily?
 - how to make cross platform code?
 - executing some (weird hardware based)game ideas if unreal/unity can't

 - get the general idea for a game engine.... then use a more fleshed out game engine
