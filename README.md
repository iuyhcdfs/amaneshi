amaneshi is my game engine

if i make an actual game worth selling, its probably not with this engine (see roadmap for why)

goals:
 - use c++ only without worrying about targeting varying systems or consoles
 - code is reusuable and consistent
 - enjoy creating the code you'd just use existing libraries for when you're making a proper game
