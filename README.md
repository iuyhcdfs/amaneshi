a c++ sandbox.

Goals:

Code is nice to read
Code works (in progress)
Code is actually reusable (because of the above)
Code doesn't have to be the fastest
Code is fun to make and think about
I learn stuff and implement it here because otherwise it wouldn't be my sandbox

Irregular updates - Take your time. Life is only short because y'all keep comparing it to eternity.

wtfpl license because in terms of game engines there are better choices ahaha
